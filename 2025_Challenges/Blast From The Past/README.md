# Blast From The Past

During cleanup at the Stark Expo, technicians discovered a fragment of data from one of Tony’s early Arc Reactor experiments.  
The file seems to pulse in rhythmic binary — some kind of encoded signature.  

Rumor says Stark used to protect his prototype logs using a *feedback resonance key* — and named after something to close to his heart.

Your mission: uncover what the is binary hiding.
Good luck
