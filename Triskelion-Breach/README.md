# Triskelion-Breach

S.H.I.E.L.D.’s central command, the Triskelion, has fallen. During the evacuation, fragments of a classified data key were dispersed across the area to prevent HYDRA from recovering them. Intelligence reports suggest one fragment was hidden near the structure spanning the river directly opposite the Triskelion’s base of operations. The logs imply the fragment was hidden somewhere in the public data surrounding the site—something that blends in with everyday information. Passive reconnaissance has yielded a single image of the structure. Use it to pinpoint the location and uncover the hidden key.
